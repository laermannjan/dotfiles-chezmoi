# Doom Nvim Documentation

Doom Nvim is a port to Neovim of the [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)
configuration framework for [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) adapted
for all vimmer who want less framework in their framework and the performance of
a handmade configuration (or better). It can be a base for your own setup or a
resource for Neovim enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite editor and how to
do X things on it by using Lua.

Doom Nvim is an opinionated collection of reasonable (and optional) defaults with
a focus on performance (both runtime and startup) and on abstraction-light, readable
code design, so that there is less between you and Neovim.

> The documentation is designed to be viewed within Doom Nvim. Access it by pressing
> `:h doom_nvim`.
